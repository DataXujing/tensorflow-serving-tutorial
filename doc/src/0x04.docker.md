# Docker Images that Serves Tensorflow Slim Models

## Overview

In this section, we use the model servables and clients to create docker images taht serves the tensorflow models.

In particular, we aim to create two docker images, one serves the models with grpc and protobuf as communication protocal, 
whereas the other one with additional rest and json support.
