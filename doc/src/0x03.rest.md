# Tensorflow Serving with Tensorflow Slim Models

## Overview

In previous section, we built and served several slim models, including inception-v4 and inception-resnet-v2.
These native Tensorflow Serving services uses gRPC and protobuf as communcation protocal. A similiar service
uses REST and JSON could also be beneifical for general users.  

In this section, we create a REST client `slim_unified_client_rest.py`, corresponding to the gRPC client 
`slim_unified_client.py`, and demonstrate how to serve this API using uWSGI and Nginx. 

In case no interest in uWSGI and Nginx, skip to section about docker image directly. The docker image section
shows how to use the gRPC and REST service from docker image, rather than how to build these service.
 
Let's start!
